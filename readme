To create a git repository, at least there are two ways:

(1) in a directory "2018_July_19_20_SoftwareCarpentryWorkshop" of the local machine, "git init" to create a git reporsitory
    commit any files in the directory.
    then go to github, create a new remote repository "2018_July_19_20_SoftwareCarpentryWorkshop".  Github automatically prompts the steps to complete the creation of the repository.

    In this case, we go back to local machine and do the following:

    "git remote add origin https://github.com/YulongXieGitHub/2018_July_19_20_SoftwareCarpentryWorkshop.git"
    "git push -u origin master"
